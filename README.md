# VisualMultiviewReconstruction

The Intention: 
	It is a personal project for building up 3D scene reconstruction application and plugin for Mac, iOS, and Unity. Build up my own knowledge, problem-solving skill, C++ coding ability for this topic, which involves 3 different displines in computer vision, parallel programming, and computer graphic.  

The Objective:
	Be able to reconstruct static scene separated from dynamic scene.
	
Subtasks:
	- Bur effect - OpenCL
	- Depth of View effect - OpenGL, OpenCL
	- ML task: Multi-view Calibration out of FoV - OpenCV, OpenCL
	- AP task: Surface Reconstruction and Visualization - OpenGL, OpenCL
	- Simulated Dataset Collection Interface - Unity
	- Unity plugin for mobile and desktop - Unity, iOS, Mac


Task Planning:
	Coming Soon
